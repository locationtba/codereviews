# Location Tba Smart Contract Reviews
The reviews here are not an endorsement or discouragement of any one project. Chances are I don't know anything about the project. I am merely looking at code and writing down my comments. No dev is perfect, including myself. The goal is not to put anyone down, but to challenge devs to think more critically when it comes to writing smart contracts, in order to save the community as much ETH as possible. I am open to feedback on my code reviews, as well as on the structure/format of the reviews.
